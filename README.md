# Atlas

This is: let's do something with Github's check-runs API in Haskell.

### Goals
- Integrate with your existing CI setup with the check-runs API to get e.g. inline hlint, `stack build`, `hspec` annotations
- High level DSL for describing your CI output
- Playground for me experimenting with Haskell
